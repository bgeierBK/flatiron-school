<!-- Specify the type of document we're creating. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- Specify our page's non-visible metadata. -->
<head>
 <meta lang="en" />
 <!-- Remember to `defer` your JavaScript, so that it runs only after your DOM loads. -->
 <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
</head>

<!--
  The <body> element represents the content of your webpage.
  In terms of the DOM tree, the body is the root **parent** of everything on your site.
  What we write inside it here is the **static** content of our site.
  We'll use JavaScript (and sometimes CSS) to specify things that happen
  **after** load, i.e. the **dynamic** content of our site.
-->
<body>
  <!-- In this example, I want the user to see the page's heading and author **on load**, -->
  <!--    which is why it belongs here and not in `index.js`. -->
  <h1>DOM Manipulation</h1>
  <!-- The <address> element is used to denote a document's contact information. -->
  <!-- In this example, <address> is a child of <body>, and <strong> is a child of <address>. -->
  <!-- Said another way, <address> is the parent of <strong>, and <body> is the parent of <address>. -->
  <!-- If you want some practice understanding these relationships, try drawing out this page's DOM tree! -->
  <!-- You can use the `class` attribute to identify groups of related elements outside of `index.html`. -->
  <address class="address">by <strong>Sakib Rasul</strong></address>
  <div id="dates">
    <!-- You can use an element's `id` attribute to uniquely identify it outside of `index.html`. -->
    <p id="today">Today.</p>
    <!-- By definition, an `id` must be unique. -->
    <p id="tomorrow">Tomorrow.</p>
    <!-- In other words, an `id` is a unique identifier! -->
    <p id="forever">Forever?</p>
  </div>
</body>
